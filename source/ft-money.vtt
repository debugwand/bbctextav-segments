00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.430 align:middle line:90%
10 common myths about divorce.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Couples in the process
of splitting up

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.430 align:middle line:84%
need to wise up,
say divorce lawyers.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.710 align:middle line:90%
We reveal how later in the show.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Merryn Somerset Webb joins us
to comment on the latest news

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:90%
for investment trust investors.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Not all of it bad.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And can you save money and
still have a social life?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
As the FT launches its
thrift off experiment,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Kate Bailey is in
the studio to discuss

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:84%
how to spend wisely
and save in style.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to The Money Show,
the FT's weekly podcast

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:84%
about personal
finance and investing.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm Claer Barrett, FT Money
editor bringing you this week's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:90%
news in downloadable form.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Have you been
watching The Split?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:90%
I'll confess.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm absolutely hooked on
this BBC One drama, which

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
follows the fortunes
and failures

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of a group of high profile
divorce lawyers in London.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
There have been some really
big shockers in the series.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And, sadly, this is also true
in real life as people commonly

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
make the wrong
assumptions about divorce

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and, in particular, how your
finances stand to be split.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Joining me to discuss
is Lucy Warwick-Ching,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
FT Money's digital editor.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Lucy.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, this got a
roaring response online,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
not least because many of
the most powerful myths

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
about divorce concern adultery.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that is the key word
that got people commenting

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and reading the piece.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But there are some other
great myths in there, as well.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But, so, on the
topic of adultery.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.815 align:middle line:84%
So people often think that
because their partner has

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
committed adultery or they've
had an affair with somebody

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
else, it's hurt them
very deeply and it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.557 align:middle line:84%
very key to their
feeling that they often

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
think that they're going to get
a bigger financial settlement.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this
isn't the case.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:84%
The courts recognise that
marriages break down.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And what the courts
are more interested in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
is what resources you
each have available

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and how they are to
be divided fairly.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So, unfortunately, if your
partner commits adultery

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
or behaves unreasonably,
you won't automatically

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
get a bigger settlement
for them to be--

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
for you to get a more
advantageous one,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
you have to actually look at how
the party's behaviour has had

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:84%
an impact on your
relationship, and file for kind

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:90%
of unreasonable behaviour.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So that surprises
lots of people.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But while we're on the
subject of adultery,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
the actual legal
definition rests

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
on this being committed with
a member of the opposite sex.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
This surprised everybody
that I mentioned it to.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It had people talking
about it in the office

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and disagreeing about it.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So I had to really go
back to the lawyers

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and really check this one out.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
archaic English laws

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that many believe to be-- quite
rightly so-- discriminatory.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But the way the English law
works at the moment is that it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
only recognises adultery
between a man and a woman.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.950 align:middle line:84%
That said, the courts may
actually be sympathetic

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
because they do understand
that relationships

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
happen between lots
of different people.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take it to the
court and the judge looks

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
at your case, then they may
deem it to be unreasonable

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:90%
behaviour.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So you won't automatically
be able to file for grounds

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
for divorce when
adultery is committed

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.134 align:middle line:90%
with a member of the same sex.

00:03:09.134 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks for
clearing that up, Lucy.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But the article you
wrote on FT Money

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:90%
cites the 10 most common myths.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.784 align:middle line:84%
And we've dealt
with two of them.

00:03:15.784 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Read the piece for the rest.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But you also go into
another worrying aspect,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that divorcing couples
often don't think of.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Namely, their cybersecurity.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, many people share their
passwords with their spouses.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when everything's rosy
and the relationship is going

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:90%
really well, this is fine.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But, actually,
they kind of forget

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that when things
are going wrong,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that actually it's very
easy with devices these days

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to look at something that your
partner has sent because it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.065 align:middle line:90%
may pop up on the screen.

00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases,
high profile cases,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
there's been examples
of where affairs

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
have come to light
because one partner sent

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
a text to the person they're
having an affair with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.095 align:middle line:84%
and it's popped up
on the family iPad.

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Good grief!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And so yes.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more
important to not leave

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:90%
yourself exposed online.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that really surprised

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
me was that people
could see e-mails,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, from your
divorce lawyer.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
One was saying she had found
out because a password hadn't

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:90%
been changed.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.838 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But the thing to
be said actually

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:90%
is don't be tempted to spy.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So although you may have access
to your partner's e-mails

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
or you may be able to log into
their WhatsApp or anything,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.904 align:middle line:84%
it's illegal to actually
access your partner's details.

00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, that--
that's quite obvious.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
But it may be that people
might not really know about it.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, if you
do come across something

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that you found in your
partner's online accounts, then

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you won't be able to use
this in law against them.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.241 align:middle line:84%
And you also may end up with
a prison sentence or a fine.

00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you very much
there to Lucy Warwick-Ching.

The 10 Things You Ought to
Know About Getting Divorced

at ft.com/money.

00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:04.345 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, the
piece is excellent,

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:07.490 align:middle line:84%
but the reader comments
of the bottom, oh, tasty.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, Lucy.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Coming up on The Money
Show, your chance

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to win a pair of tickets
to FT Weekend Festival,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:90%
worth 190 pounds.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.159 align:middle line:84%
Before that, many listeners
are fans of investment trusts.

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of the oldest collective
investment vehicles

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
on the stock market, but oldest
doesn't necessarily mean best.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, a
report out last week

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
showed that investment
trusts have consistently

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:84%
outperformed other funds for
much of the past 20 years.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Hurrah.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
However, rows about
fees are never far away

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
as FT columnist Merryn Somerset
Webb has been finding out.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And she joins me
on the line now.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Merryn.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Claer.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all,
as an investor,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:84%
tell us why you love
investment trusts?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've always been a
fan of investment trust

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
because I love the
way that they can

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
hold very long-term capital.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you have
an open-ended fund,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.090 align:middle line:84%
when people want
to buy and sell,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
you actually have to
buy and sell the assets.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
In investment trusts,
the fund manager

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
never has to buy and sell
assets for short-term reasons.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
They can just hold them
for a very long time

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.369 align:middle line:84%
into as a pool of
permanent capital.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's very important.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.993 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that
they have boards.

00:06:10.993 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on a couple of
investment trust boards myself.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.119 align:middle line:84%
So I know what it
feels like to be there,

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
protecting the interests
of the end shareholders.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Boards don't always do what
they're supposed to do,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but they're there for
a specific reason.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:90%
I love that, as well.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Also, historically, they've
had lower charges overall,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and lower costs overall, should
I say, than open-ended funds.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But I've also always
had the feeling

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that they tend for most
of the reasons I mentioned

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.114 align:middle line:84%
to outperform over
the long-term.

00:06:35.114 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, several studies
have been done into this,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
but mainly by the
investment trust industry.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.786 align:middle line:84%
And that comes under "well, they
would say that, wouldn't they?"

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So last week we had
the first report out

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
from a group of academics from
Cass Business School looking

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:84%
at this properly to say,
well, let's actually try

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.775 align:middle line:84%
and find out in a totally
neutral academic point of view

00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
on whether these things
actually outperform or not.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So they've looked back
over the last 18 years.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.006 align:middle line:90%
So it's not super long-term.

00:06:59.006 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's long-term enough.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And the results are rather more
exciting for investment trust

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
fans than you would even expect
it in that the performance gap

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.975 align:middle line:84%
between open-ended funds
and close-ended funds--

00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
so open-ended being the
unit trust most people buy,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
close-ended funds referring
to investment trusts--

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:90%
comes in at about 1.4% a year.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.644 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's real money.

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Compound that over a
decade and you're talking

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:90%
about an enormous difference.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about compounding
for our readers who--

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:90%
as we know--

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
like lock-and-leave investments.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
They like to invest
for the long-term.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to be fiddling around

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
with their portfolios
all the time, making--

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
you know, chopping and
changing for the sake of it.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.552 align:middle line:84%
So this, I would imagine,
would be magic to their ears.

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, absolutely.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.301 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's lots of
caveats to it, of course,

00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:46.824 align:middle line:90%
as there is with all data.

00:07:46.824 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Their research doesn't
take into account

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
every single closed-ended
fund because lots

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.472 align:middle line:84%
are in sectors that can't be
compared with unit trusts.

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you have infrastructure
funds and this kind of thing,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
you can't compare
them across the board.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.725 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
include everything.

00:07:58.725 --> 00:07:59.642 align:middle line:90%
There's survivor bias.

00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:02.183 align:middle line:84%
There's-- you know, there's all
sorts of things in there that

00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:90%
make this data messy.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's
important to remember

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that the average
investor does not

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
have the experience of
being in the average fund.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So the average-- the
average open-ended fund

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
underperforms its benchmark
by 80 basis points a year.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:90%
0.8% per year.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.044 align:middle line:84%
Which is shocking, but most
people's portfolios don't do

00:08:19.044 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:90%
that because they're--

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
particularly FT
readers, of course--

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.399 align:middle line:84%
they're not stupid enough
to invest in rubbish funds

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.023 align:middle line:84%
So the average fund is not
the average experience.

00:08:26.023 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of
that stuff going on.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
However, there does
seem to be something

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
that suggested an investment
trust over the long-term

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.089 align:middle line:84%
can do better for you
than an open-ended fund.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I think that
comes back to the points

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned to you.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The role of directors, possibly
to better management skills,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.164 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
To the role of
[? gearing, ?] investment

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
trusts can borrow
money to invest.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
It has a very small effect
on the performance numbers

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
on that, but it is there.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting research,
but another important caveat--

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:90%
it is historical.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:90%
This is not about the future.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:90%
It is about the past.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that has happened
over the last decade or so

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
is that the costs of
a closed-ended fund

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and an open-ended fund have
begun to come together.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I suspect--

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.801 align:middle line:84%
although the academics
don't bring this out--

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
but one of the things
I suspect has caused

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the outperformance
of investment trusts

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:90%
has been their lower cost.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.364 align:middle line:90%
Now as that margin narrows--

00:09:18.364 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
or has more than narrowed,
actually, in many cases--

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.396 align:middle line:84%
we'll begin to see just how
long-term the differences are.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I suspect they'll remain,
but they won't be as big.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, on the subject of fees,
you wrote your FT column

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
last but one weekend ago
about the ongoing spat

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:84%
between the board of the Invesco
Perpetual Enhanced Income

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Trust, which is known as
IPE-- a bit of a mouthful--

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and they have asked Invesco--
you are their investment

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
manager-- to reduce the
fees it charges them

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:90%
with fairly disastrous results.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing about
these kind of things

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
all part of my campaign to
make myself really popular

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:90%
in the financial industry.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.173 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I think,
taking me one step further--

00:09:55.173 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:90%
one step further down that path.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting case
because one of the things

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.729 align:middle line:84%
that investment trusts
have all had to do--

00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and, again, I say this from the
point of view of an investor,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I've done this, and
a director-- one

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of the things
that's being really

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
important in the industry is
to bring these costs down.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.066 align:middle line:90%
To bring down management fees.

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:84%
To make sure that
long-term performance

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:90%
is not affected by high costs.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So all boards have been going
to their managers, the people

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.175 align:middle line:84%
they delegate the management of
the assets to, and say to them,

00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:90%
look, do you know what?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Your costs are too high.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.169 align:middle line:90%
1% plus the performance fee.

00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:90%
We can't have it anymore.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We need all these fees
down below 1% a year.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Preferably below 60
basis points per year.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So the board of this
particular trust

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.584 align:middle line:84%
did address this
with their managers.

00:10:29.584 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are all sorts of
shenanigans in the middle

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.416 align:middle line:84%
that it's quite hard
to get a handle on.

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But the net result was
that rather than go ahead

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
with we're cutting
fees down to a level

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that I think the board thought
they agreed, Invesco resigned.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there will now be
hopefully a [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:90%
of some kind and a new manager.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty is, of
course, that Invesco

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
controls quite a lot of
the shares in the trust

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore,
may have a chance

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
of being able to force through
the result that they want.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting case,
partly because of the dynamic

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
between directors and managers.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And here we do see
directors doing--

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.325 align:middle line:84%
or so it seems-- doing what
it is that we want them to do,

00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
which is acting in the interest
of their end shareholders

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:90%
by forcing down costs.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Hooray.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing pushback from
the fund management industry.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.997 align:middle line:90%
Not entirely unexpected.

00:11:15.997 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And the third dynamic
that we're seeing here

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of
shareholder democracy.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, if Invesco controls,
say 16% of the shares,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.857 align:middle line:84%
but manages to get their own
way by voting those shares--

00:11:25.857 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if they
will or won't, of course,

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.648 align:middle line:84%
because at this point
it hasn't happened.

00:11:29.648 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But if they were
able to use those 16%

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to get their own
way with the trust,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
then that would have, I think,
interesting implications

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
for shareholder
democracy in the sector.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, many of
the shares in that trust

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
are held by retail investors
through [INAUDIBLE] accounts,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
because they own them on
online brokerage platforms.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
So when that comes to--

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
when push comes to
shove on the vote,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
it's actually very hard to
mobilise the votes of all

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:90%
of those small investors.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
institutional and particularly

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
activists-- activists investors
in investment trust-- no,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've--

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been told recently
by several people

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.227 align:middle line:84%
that the big activist
funds in the US,

00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, are careful when
they're targeting investment

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
trusts, go for investment
trust with very

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.854 align:middle line:84%
high levels of retail
investors because they know

00:12:16.854 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that the higher the
number of retail investors

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.686 align:middle line:84%
there are, and not
ordinary investors like you

00:12:20.686 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and me, the more likely
they are to be able to get

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
their way with a relatively
small number of shares

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
because we're so
hard to mobilise.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so, you know,
spread around the platform.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.807 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to do the
admin to get your vote

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
through on a platform,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, we've become
effectively disenfranchised.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And that means that we
are not able to exercise

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.831 align:middle line:84%
the democratic control we should
have over a lot of the things

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:90%
that we own.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just true of
investment trusts, by the way.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's true of pretty much every
listed share in the market.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.978 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks very much there
to Merryn Somerset Webb.

00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
You can read her column in the
money section of the FT weekend

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
newspaper this Saturday
about the outperformance

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:90%
of investment trusts.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Or read her column online,
ft.com, from Friday morning.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Who would want to
be a millennial?

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We are consistently told that
younger workers have never

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:90%
had it so bad.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Depressed wages, less
generous pensions,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, a totally
unaffordable housing market.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Saving money rather than
spending it on avocados

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
is broadly the solution given
out by the popular press.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't do hair
shirts on The FT Money show.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So we've started an
experiment this week

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to hopefully prove that
saving money does not

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
have to be at the
expense of having fun.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Joining me now is my
colleague, Kate Bailey,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:84%
who writes a popular
millennial money column.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.785 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Kate.

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Claer.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So, firstly, can you explain
how this thrift off challenge

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
came about?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is part of the
FT's millennial moment series.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.254 align:middle line:84%
So, as you said, we
all know that saving

00:13:49.254 --> 00:13:50.545 align:middle line:90%
is a big worry for millennials.

00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We're a generation
struggling to save for homes,

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
facing a squeeze on earnings,
facing a worse pension future

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:90%
than previous generations.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to look
at how important

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:84%
or just how important it is to
save small amounts over time

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and how that can kind
of really build up

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.616 align:middle line:84%
to fairly significant
sums over the long term,

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and help with those
things like pension

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:90%
pots and your investments.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to look at it
in a bit more of a fun way.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So we decided that you and I
are going to compete for a week

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.937 align:middle line:84%
and see who can have the
most fun on the least money.

00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't really
want to just stay at home

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.221 align:middle line:90%
with a tin of baked beans--

00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.887 align:middle line:84%
--because that doesn't feel
very millennial, either.

00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:28.678 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we're going
to see which one of us

00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
can beat the other by finding
the most inventive low cost

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:90%
things to do.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I should say at this point
I'm clearly not a millennial.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm 41 years old.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm probably a
little bit too young--

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
she says hopefully-- to be
a member of Generation X.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But I have always been good
at saving money nevertheless.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one advantage
that I might have over people

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:84%
of your generation
is that my thrift

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:90%
muscles are well-developed.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get used to
the habit of saving money.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And once you're there,
it never leaves you.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So maybe a lot of the things
I'm doing already-- like cycling

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
to work, making my lunch
everyday, which, let's face it,

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I could afford to
go to Pret A Manger

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and spend six pounds
on an avocado bloomer.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I
don't want to do that.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather put the money
aside still and spend it

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:90%
on a nicer holiday.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, that's
interesting because I

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:84%
think I'm almost the opposite,
despite having been nearly cash

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
strapped for most
of my young life,

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I think really my go-to habit
is a little more feckless.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So, without giving too
much of an advantage

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
to me, what are you
going to do over

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:90%
the course of the next week?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Technology is going to
play a big part I think

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.414 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of our decisions.

00:15:35.414 --> 00:15:35.913 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:35.913 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the key, isn't
it, is to do the kind of things

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.462 align:middle line:84%
that we would want
to be doing anyway.

00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to
stop going out--

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Even eating out, and
seeing my friends.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I have been
raking through the app store

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to find kind of
useful apps that will

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
let me do all those things
either for free or just

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:90%
for a cut price.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, things like--

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
things like open theatre, things
like seeing comedy or music,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
going out for dinner,
and thrifty lunches.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.111 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, the app store
has been my friend so far.

00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've also been starting
with making a budget.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually loaded 100
pounds onto my Monzo card.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Other ones are
available on the market.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But this is something that
is linked to my bank account,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
but will give me a kind of
distinct wallet of money

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
to hopefully guide
my spending, and not

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
make me think, oh,
I can buy this,

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
because I've got an
unlimited amount of money.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And I do think like the boring
things, like setting a budget,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:90%
can be important.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't make a plan,

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
then what are you
going to stick to?

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But equally, I've been
talking to friends-- again,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
not millennial friends--

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:84%
who are used to finding ways of
having fun on a limited budget.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I'm going to try

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:84%
is hosting a soccer club,
which is quite a funky thing.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.377 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people get
very excited about it.

00:16:54.377 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It's basically going round
for dinner at a mate's house,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
but a bit-- a bit
more organised.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And hoping they will
invite you round.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.369 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:03.369 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I'll be
down on the week.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But if readers have got
ideas for us to try out,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:84%
we're right at the
beginning of the week.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's still time
to send in your ideas.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:90%
Email us now money@ft.com.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And remember that the best
entry will win a pair of tickets

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
to the FT Weekend
Festival in September,

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
worth a cool 190
pounds, where you

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
will get to meet me,
no doubt Kate, and also

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Merryn Somerset Webb, who
you heard from earlier.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And the full terms and
conditions are online

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.024 align:middle line:90%
at ft.com/thriftoff.

00:17:33.024 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kate, I'll give
you the last word.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.606 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you're going
to win this contest?

00:17:36.606 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting calmly confident.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll obviously be
writing all about this

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.985 align:middle line:90%
and making a video for FT.com.

00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll bring you news of
that on a future podcast.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
That's it from The Money
Show this week, however.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
We will be back next
week at the usual time.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.
